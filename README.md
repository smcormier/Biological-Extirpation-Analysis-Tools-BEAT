# Biological-Extirpation-Analysis-Tools-BEAT
Step-by-step calculation and spreadsheet tools for predicting stressor levels that extirpate genera and species.  (1) Supplemental Appendix S1:  underlying calculation of the XC95 and HC05 values with a detailed example using SC as the stressor and benthic invertebrates as the affected taxa. (2) Supplemental Appendices S2: XC95 BEAT. (3) Supplemental Appendices S3: HC05 BEAT. (4) Supplemental Appendices S4 metadata.  (5) Supplemental Appendices S5 full data set. (6) Supplemental Appendix S6: XC95 values for 176 distinct aquatic benthic invertebrate genera. (7) Supplemental Appendix S7: plots of probability of observing a genus for discrete ranges of specific conductivity (SC). (8) Supplemental Appendix S8: plots of the proportion of occurrence of a genus for discrete ranges of SC. (9) Supplemental Appendix S9:  biogeographic distributions of the genera included in the data set.
